# dagchat

An open source wallet with end-to-end encrypted, on chain messaging for nano and banano using the dagchat protocol.

This application is not yet released. Any versions are test versions and come with no guarantees. Whilst messages are in theory encrypted end-to-end, the encrypted data is being put onto a public blockchain. The cryptography used in the dagchat protocol (and implementation of) has not been audited so it is advised not to include sensitive data within messages.
